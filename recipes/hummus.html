    <h2>About the dish:</h2>
    <p>This hummus recipe was perfected after a weekend of experimentation.
        Everyone that has tried it has loved it! Several people have said it's 
        the best they've tasted. It tastes best if the beans and lemon juice 
        sit first, but if you're in a hurry everything can be blended together 
        without waiting. To serve, create wells in the hummus and drizzle with 
        olive oil and ground paprika. If desired, garnish with diced cucumbers, 
        tomatoes, and Greek olives for a festive salad/dip with pita bread.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ½ (15.5 ounce) cans garbanzo beans, 
            drained with liquid (aquafaba) reserved</li>
        <li>⅓ cup fresh lemon juice</li>
        <li>¼ cup well-stirred tahini</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon ground cayenne</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon white sugar</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt and ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place garbanzo beans, 1 1/2 tablespoon reserved aquafaba, 
            and lemon juice in a food processor. Let soak until flavors 
            combine, about 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Pulse soaked garbanzo beans until roughly chopped. Add tahini, 
            olive oil, garlic, cayenne, sugar, salt, and black pepper; blend, 
            thinning with reserved aquafaba, until hummus is smooth and 
            reaches desired consistency.</li>
    </ol>
